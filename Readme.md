## Description

_Task1:_ Locality Sensitive Hashing based on Jaccard Simmilarity.
_Task2:_ Recommendation System with a good RMSE

# Task 1: Locality Sensitive Hashing on yelp_train.csv

- Create a hash function
- Use LSH technique for creating Jaccard Simmilarty where simmilarity>0.5

# Task 2: Recommendation System

- Train using yelp_train.csv
- Validate using yelp_val.csv
- Calculate RMSE

_Case 1:_ Model-based CF recommendation system with SparkMLlib
_Case 2:_ User-based CF recommendation system
_Case 3:_ Item-based CF recommendation system

## Note:

The assignment was given as a part of course Data Mining at USC. I have no rights over the question. However the code is my own. It was performed on yelp data, the files named under business.json and review.json- to which I have no proprietary right.
